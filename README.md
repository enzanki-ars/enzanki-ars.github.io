*I do apologize about this repository.  I do not want to edit Git history, so
it has gotten a little out of hand....  Additionally, there are no comments
documenting the code in this repository.  Normally I would add inline comments,
but as this website is hosted as is, I want to keep the download size low for
mobile phones.*
