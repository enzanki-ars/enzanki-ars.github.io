## About Me

I am studying at the Ohio State University, majoring in Computer Science and
Engineering. In high school, I was a part of the Ohio Supercomputer Center's
Summer Institute, which I used as my high school senior capstone.  In the past
couple of years, I have created various videos and projects, many of them
documented on this website.  Currently, I work with the Engineering Technology
Services at the Ohio State University, assisting with the documentation, setup,
and operation of the old and new College of Engineering network.

## Career Goals

In the future, I would like to continue expanding my knowledge and apply this
in to the field of computers, specifically in terms programming, networking,
digital video, and digital audio.   Technology never stops advancing, and I
always want to keep pace with change.  This is one of the reasons why I love
working with computers so much.  Every day, new things are being developed in
the field that I cannot wait to try and apply to my daily life.  

In my free time, I enjoy programming some of the various projects I am
developing.  I run and manage a set of four Raspberry Pi devices.  
Additionally, I have contributed to a couple of open source projects, while
also releasing some of my own.  Some of these projects are posted here in the
projects tab at the top.  Finally, I enjoy creating live and recorded videos,
developing programs to assist me in creating those videos.  

Across these experiences, I feel like I provide a different perspective in
terms of programming.  I focus on creating small components, that can be
repurposed in many other tasks.  For example, my live stream graphics are
saved in individual components, allowing me to combine them in whatever
method is needed, plus I can use the graphics for other videos I create.  In
other programming projects, I concentrate on making everything as small as
possible, in hopes that the code can be reused.  This website is an example
of that as every page is made up of a bunch of files that are combined to fit
the needs of the specific page.
