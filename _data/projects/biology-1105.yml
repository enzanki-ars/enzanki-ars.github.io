        - Hydrocarbons contain only hydrogen and carbon atoms. The bonds between the atoms store energy that can be released.
        - Polymers come in the form of carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and proteins.  These have various roles such as being the backbone of DNA/RNA, fuel storage, provide structure to cells, and many more.
