_In response to the [recent iMessage policy changes](http://www.hilliardschools.org/teens-and-the-internet-the-power-and-pitfalls-of-a-digital-life/)._

Dear Hilliard City School District Administrators,

Until yesterday, all student iPads had the capacity to send and receive iMessages, an easy to use platform for students to ask questions and receive help from their fellow classmates. Today, we received confirmation that the Messages app was removed from all grade 6-8 iPads due to the abuse by a small group of students. 

The general understanding was that these iPads were designed to not only be a classroom utility, but a networking platform for the students. One of the most important use cases of this iMessage platform was the ability for students to ask questions and receive quick help from their peers. 

In this way, middle school students could receive help almost immediately after requesting it, instead of having to email a potentially busy teacher. Additionally, teachers can not actively check their email to assist students, especially during the late hours of the night. If students can help each other easily in class, they should be able to do the same at home. 

While the senior members of the Computer Club will not be able to experience this new connectivity fostered by the iPads, we still hope that this policy will be reversed. By reversing this policy, we would be able to preserve this social and collaborative environment that will benefit motivated students in the years to come. 

Sincerely,

The Following Darby Computer Club Officers:

 - Ali Akhtar
 - Alex Shafer
 - Jacob Sims
