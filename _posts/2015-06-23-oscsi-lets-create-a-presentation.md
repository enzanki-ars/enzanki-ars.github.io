title: OSCSI - Let's Create a Presentation!
---

It was another day of breaking then fixing things. We continued learning about router
protocols, connecting the eight routers in odd fashions to better understand
how connections work. For example, we have been focusing on creating complex
networks, not exactly efficient networks. We also have been discussing how we
will present our project. I look forward to our presentation and can't wait to
show what we have learned.
