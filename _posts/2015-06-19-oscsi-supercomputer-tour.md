We finished our training for creating and connecting switches. After saving the configuration
we created for connecting two switches together, we started wiring all of our
switches together as shown below.

After working on our new network, we visited the State of Ohio Computer Center where
the supercomputers are housed. We were able to see all three of the current supercomputers;
Glenn, Ruby, and Oakley. Of the three supercomputers, Glenn is the oldest and
will be replaced soon. Glenn is significantly different than the other two. In
order to cool the supercomputers, Ruby and Oakley trap the heat in-between the
two rows and cools from the outside, but Glenn traps cool air on the inside and
pushes the heat out. Glenn also has a slightly different set of resources on
the inside. While Glenn contains only CPUs (Central Processing Unit), Ruby and
Oakley also contain GPUs (Graphic Processing Unit) for even faster computing
for certain types of jobs. Below is a labeled picture of the inside of one Glenn
node.
