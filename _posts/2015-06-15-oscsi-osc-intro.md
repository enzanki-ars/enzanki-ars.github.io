title: OSCSI - Ohio Supercomputer Center Intro
---

{% include ytblockcheck.html %}

Another exciting day at the Summer Institute. To start the day, we had an introduction
to the Ohio Supercomputer Center and the Supercomputers they utilize. Supercomputers
are defined as computers that are exponentially faster than computers used at
home. Initially, I thought that these supercomputers are one large computer with
many processors, but they are actually many smaller nodes with fast interconnects.
These nodes can communicate with the other nodes via a fast, low latency connection
like Ethernet. We also discussed OARNet, originally created to connect researchers
to the Supercomputer via phone lines. Currently, the system is used to connect
many of the universities, schools, and public broadcasting networks, for example,
our local PBS affiliates, with high speed internet. This system offers speeds
about 5000 times faster than your home internet and most of the traffic that
passes through is, not surprisingly, Netflix. I would be curious to know if the
Hilliard City School District uses OARNet for their Internet.

We also toured the Ohio Supercomputer Center, where we were also shown some of the
projects they have been working on. One of these projects was a simulator, using
an Oculus Rift, of a home where one had to identify some of the hazards that
medical staff might encounter when treating a patent at their home. Below is
a video of myself while wearing this simulator. Sadly, I do not have a video
of the environment I was in.

In the last half of the day, we discussed the five projects offered. I hope to be
a part of the Networking Design and Engineering project where we will create
our own miniature version of OARNet. Afterwards, we were given an introduction
to UNIX, which, while I knew a lot about, I did learn some new topics.

I am very excited for tomorrow where we will have an introduction to MATLAB, then
start on our training for our project.
