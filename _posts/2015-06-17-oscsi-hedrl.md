Today, we toured the High Energy Density Research Lab where they fire a very powerful
laser at a small piece of metal to observe the protons emitted. To demonstrate
how powerful these lasers are and show how they test the accuracy of the lasers,
they placed a piece of burn paper in part of the laser amplification system.
Below is a video of this demonstration.

Below is a picture of what this lazer did to the back side of the paper.

After our tour, we were introduced to the Juniper Networking Switches by our instructor,
Mr. John Graham. After booting up the machines, which were louder than we expected,
we learned how to use the command line to access the switches. Our group then
spent the remainder of the day investigation networking concepts.
