Welcome! First post on my blog here, and first day at the <a href="https://www.osc.edu/education/si"> Ohio Supercomputer
	Center's Summer Institute</a>. Today was just a check-in and get to know everyone,
but I am really excited for the rest of the next two weeks. We will be learning
about all sorts of topics, ranging from Unix to MATLAB, and visiting many of
the buildings around the Ohio State Campus, including a tour of the High Energy
Density Physics Area. Tomorrow, we will be introduced to the <a href="https://osc.edu/education/si/projects">five projects</a>				we will choose from: <a href="https://www.osc.edu/content/nanofluidics">
	Lab-on-a-chip Nanofluidics</a>, <a href="https://www.osc.edu/education/si/projects/comet">Image
	Processing</a>, Cancer Cell Migration, Invasion and Metastasis, Networking Design
and Engineering, and The Physics of Addicting Video Games.

If you would like to view the presentation we were given at the beginning of camp,
it is available <a href="https://prezi.com/embed/-r93jwp47rha/">here</a>.
