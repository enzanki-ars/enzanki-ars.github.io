## Explorer's Post 891

For the past two and a half years, I have participated in
[Explorer's Post 891](http://post891.org/), a extra-curricular activity
sponsored by the Boy Scouts of America.  This group is designed to provide high
school students with the opportunity to learn more about the field of computer
science.  

As a student in college, I am now considered one of the instructors for the
group.  I have been able to share some of the things I have learned while
working for the Engineering Technology Services.  We have discussed recent
topics ranging from the
[October 21st attacks on DYN](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-the-dyn-outage-affected-cloudflare/)
to electronic voting in elections, and low-level topics such as the role of the
kernel in Unix to how the assembly language works.  

While being able to volunteer there has become increasingly difficult due to a
recent location change, I hope to be able continue teaching high school students
about the field of Computer Science.
