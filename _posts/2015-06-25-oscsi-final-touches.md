Today we visited OSU's Center for Automotive Research. I did not realize that OSU
designed and raced many different types of vehicles. We saw their Formula SAE
car, the Bullet Car, the EcoCar, and more. I personally think the EcoCar was
the most interesting. They used a Cheverolet chassis and used a Honda engine
that they modified to use E-85.

We also focused on finishing our presentation. While our network is not fully operational,
the focus of our project was not on the final network fully working, but was
on learning how networks operate and the protocols behind them. I cannot wait
to present our project.
