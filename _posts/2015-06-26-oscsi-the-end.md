Sad to see the end of our two weeks at the Summer Institute, but I enjoyed my time
here. Our presentation is a available below in two different formats. The default
video contains both the recording and the accompanying slides. If you would like
to view the video without the slides, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kkjH9QOtgn4?enablejsapi=1&origin=https://enzanki-ars.github.io"
target="video">here</a>. Both video options are available below. If you would
like to view our presentation separately, it is available
<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cDQsJsc1zLefQzSubo47e5MjTkTNWgNZr3Y_ImRFcXA/present?slide=id.p">here</a>.

During these two weeks, I also took many pictures, but did not want to clutter the
blog post too much. If you would like to see all of the pictures I took, they
are available
<a href="https://goo.gl/photos/ikWPQUVJVVMkDDeo6">here</a> with captions. The
Supercomputer Center also took great photos and they are available
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/oscsi/photos_stream">here</a>.
