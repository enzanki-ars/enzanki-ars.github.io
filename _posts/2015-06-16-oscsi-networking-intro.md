title: OSCSI - The End
---

I am now a part of the networking project group. After an introduction to MATLAB,
an interesting and unique type of programming language (see example MATLAB creation
by Vilas Winstein below), we started on our project training. During our training
time, we discussed the binary numbering system. We also discussed how to convert
from binary to hexadecimal in order to determine why IP addresses are written
the way they are. Tomorrow, we will investigate how networks operate.
