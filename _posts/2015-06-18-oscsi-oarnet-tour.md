title: OSCSI - OARNet Tour
---

<h2>6-18-2015: Thursday</h2>

Today, we toured one of OARNet's data centers in Columbus. I was shocked by the number
of wires everywhere and that the center is shared between many other companies.
The amount of data passed though OARNet and power used is staggering. After a
tour of OARNet, we continued learning how to connect multiple switches together
as shown below.

I have been holding off on posting about what we do at the dorms until now, but I
thought now would be a great time to talk about it here. We have played so many
games at the dorms, ranging anywhere from poker, played with goldfish and M&amp;Ms
at chips, to Apples to Apples. We also end up spending a significant amount of
time talking to the other groups about what we did in our projects.

Also, there are massive amounts of food surrounding me even as I am writing this.
As lunch is provided for us, our meal cards have $20 left that we should use
before the end of the night. As we do not want to waste this money, we end up
getting a lot of snacks and beverages:
