Dear Hilliard City School District Administrators,

Last year (December 4th, 2015), the officers of the Darby Computer Club
[issued a statement]({% post_url 2015-12-04-open-letter %}) outlying our
concerns about the removal of the Messages app from school issued iPads. Even
though I am now a student at OSU, the arguments made in the previous letter are
still valid. Below contains a updated version of the original letter addressing
the newest removal of the Messages app.

Until yesterday, all student iPads had the capacity to send and receive
iMessages, an easy to use platform for students to ask questions and receive
help from their classmates. Today, students and parents received the following
message:

> Recently we have had an increase in students using iPads as a social tool
> during school.  Our teachers have concerns that, at times, this interferes
> with students being able to concentrate on academics.   Because of this, we
> have disabled the use of iMessaging for our students.  It is our hope that our
> students will refocus and continue to use the iPads as an educational tool in
> the classroom.

The general understanding was that these iPads were designed to not only be a
classroom utility, but as a networking platform for the students. One of the
most important use cases of this iMessage platform was the ability for students
to ask questions and receive quick help from their peers.

With the iMessage platform, students were able to  receive help almost
immediately after requesting it from friends and classmates, instead of waiting
for an email from a potentially busy teacher. If students could help each other
in class, they should be able to do the same at home.

There is an unintended consequence introduced by blocking iMessage.  Students
have already discovered alternative applications to continue their discussions.
Sadly, many of these are already blocked by the district.  The only alternative
I see left for students to utilize would be Twitter, a tool the district will
most likely not block or remove due to the large amount of teachers and
administrator using the platform.  

While I am unable to experience this new connectivity fostered by the iPads, I
still hope that this policy will be reversed. By reversing this policy, we would
be able to preserve this social and collaborative environment that will benefit
motivated students in the years to come.

Sincerely,

Alex Shafer
