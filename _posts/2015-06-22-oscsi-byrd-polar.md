Let me start off by first saying that -30&deg;F is very cold. But more about that
in a moment...

Today, we continued with our networking project. We have so many wires on the table,
it isn't funny anymore. If someone brought in a pair of scissors and cut even
one wire, we would be spending the next ten minutes figuring out which one was
cut.

After some minor technical difficulties in our configurations, we visited the Byrd
Polar and Climate Research Center to learn about the types of projects they are
working on. I did not know that this research facility is one of the largest
users of the Ohio Supercomputer Center. The Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center
has been developing a model for the weather patterns in the polar regions for
pilots to use to know their landing conditions. An example of one of their live
models is accessible
<a href="http://polarmet.osu.edu/nwp/animation.php?model=antarctic_wrf&run=00&var=plot001">here</a>.

After an introduction to the models, we saw their massive collection of rocks from
the polar regions and entered the room where they store ice core samples. The
picture below of the thermometer is the temperature in the room where they cut
the samples, not the temperature of the storage room. The storage room was about
-30&deg;F when we entered. And I thought waiting at the bus stop before school
was cold during the winter...
