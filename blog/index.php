		Sad to see the end of our two weeks at the Summer Institute, but I enjoyed my time
		here. Our presentation is a available below in two different formats. The default
		video contains both the recording and the accompanying slides. If you would like
		to view the video without the slides, click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kkjH9QOtgn4?enablejsapi=1&origin=https://enzanki-ars.github.io"

		During these two weeks, I also took many pictures, but did not want to clutter the
		blog post too much. If you would like to see all of the pictures I took, they
		are available

	<h2>6-25-2015: Thursday</h2>
	<p>
		Today we visited OSU's Center for Automotive Research. I did not realize that OSU
		designed and raced many different types of vehicles. We saw their Formula SAE
		car, the Bullet Car, the EcoCar, and more. I personally think the EcoCar was
		the most interesting. They used a Cheverolet chassis and used a Honda engine
		that they modified to use E-85.
	</p>
	<p>
		We also focused on finishing our presentation. While our network is not fully operational,
		the focus of our project was not on the final network fully working, but was
		on learning how networks operate and the protocols behind them. I cannot wait
		to present our project.
	</p>

	<h2>6-24-2015: Wednesday</h2>
	<p>
		Today we focused on finalizing our "project" and starting on our presentation. I
		do applogize that this post is short, but much of what we did in our presentation.
	</p>

	<h2>6-23-2015: Tuesday</h2>
	<p>
		It was another day of breaking then fixing things. We continued learning about router
		protocols, connecting the eight routers in odd fashions to better understand
		how connections work. For example, we have been focusing on creating complex
		networks, not exactly efficient networks. We also have been discussing how we
		will present our project. I look forward to our presentation and can't wait to
		show what we have learned.

	<h2>6-22-2015: Monday</h2>
	<p>
		Let me start off by first saying that -30&deg;F is very cold. But more about that
		in a moment...
	</p>
	<p>
		Today, we continued with our networking project. We have so many wires on the table,
		it isn't funny anymore. If someone brought in a pair of scissors and cut even
		one wire, we would be spending the next ten minutes figuring out which one was
		cut.
	</p>
	<p>
		After some minor technical difficulties in our configurations, we visited the Byrd
		Polar and Climate Research Center to learn about the types of projects they are
		working on. I did not know that this research facility is one of the largest
		users of the Ohio Supercomputer Center. The Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center
		has been developing a model for the weather patterns in the polar regions for
		pilots to use to know their landing conditions. An example of one of their live
		models is accessible
		<a href="http://polarmet.osu.edu/nwp/animation.php?model=antarctic_wrf&run=00&var=plot001">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		After an introduction to the models, we saw their massive collection of rocks from
		the polar regions and entered the room where they store ice core samples. The
		picture below of the thermometer is the temperature in the room where they cut
		the samples, not the temperature of the storage room. The storage room was about
		-30&deg;F when we entered. And I thought waiting at the bus stop before school
		was cold during the winter...

		We finished our training for creating and connecting switches. After saving the configuration
		we created for connecting two switches together, we started wiring all of our
		switches together as shown below.
	</p>

	<p>
		After working on our new network, we visited the State of Ohio Computer Center where
		the supercomputers are housed. We were able to see all three of the current supercomputers;
		Glenn, Ruby, and Oakley. Of the three supercomputers, Glenn is the oldest and
		will be replaced soon. Glenn is significantly different than the other two. In
		order to cool the supercomputers, Ruby and Oakley trap the heat in-between the
		two rows and cools from the outside, but Glenn traps cool air on the inside and
		pushes the heat out. Glenn also has a slightly different set of resources on
		the inside. While Glenn contains only CPUs (Central Processing Unit), Ruby and
		Oakley also contain GPUs (Graphic Processing Unit) for even faster computing
		for certain types of jobs. Below is a labeled picture of the inside of one Glenn
		node.

	<p>
		Today, we toured one of OARNet's data centers in Columbus. I was shocked by the number
		of wires everywhere and that the center is shared between many other companies.
		The amount of data passed though OARNet and power used is staggering. After a
		tour of OARNet, we continued learning how to connect multiple switches together
		as shown below.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have been holding off on posting about what we do at the dorms until now, but I
		thought now would be a great time to talk about it here. We have played so many
		games at the dorms, ranging anywhere from poker, played with goldfish and M&amp;Ms
		at chips, to Apples to Apples. We also end up spending a significant amount of
		time talking to the other groups about what we did in our projects.
	</p>
	<p>
		Also, there are massive amounts of food surrounding me even as I am writing this.
		As lunch is provided for us, our meal cards have $20 left that we should use
		before the end of the night. As we do not want to waste this money, we end up
		getting a lot of snacks and beverages:

		Today, we toured the High Energy Density Research Lab where they fire a very powerful
		laser at a small piece of metal to observe the protons emitted. To demonstrate
		how powerful these lasers are and show how they test the accuracy of the lasers,
		they placed a piece of burn paper in part of the laser amplification system.
		Below is a video of this demonstration.

		After our tour, we were introduced to the Juniper Networking Switches by our instructor,

		we learned how to use the command line to access the switches. Our group then
		spent the remainder of the day investigation networking concepts.

		I am now a part of the networking project group. After an introduction to MATLAB,
		an interesting and unique type of programming language (see example MATLAB creation
		by Vilas Winstein below), we started on our project training. During our training
		time, we discussed the binary numbering system. We also discussed how to convert
		from binary to hexadecimal in order to determine why IP addresses are written
		the way they are. Tomorrow, we will investigate how networks operate.

	<h2>6-15-2015: Monday</h2>
	<p>
		Another exciting day at the Summer Institute. To start the day, we had an introduction
		to the Ohio Supercomputer Center and the Supercomputers they utilize. Supercomputers
		are defined as computers that are exponentially faster than computers used at
		home. Initially, I thought that these supercomputers are one large computer with
		many processors, but they are actually many smaller nodes with fast interconnects.
		These nodes can communicate with the other nodes via a fast, low latency connection
		like Ethernet. We also discussed OARNet, originally created to connect researchers
		to the Supercomputer via phone lines. Currently, the system is used to connect
		many of the universities, schools, and public broadcasting networks, for example,
		our local PBS affiliates, with high speed internet. This system offers speeds
		about 5000 times faster than your home internet and most of the traffic that
		passes through is, not surprisingly, Netflix. I would be curious to know if the
		Hilliard City School District uses OARNet for their Internet.
	</p>
	<p>
		We also toured the Ohio Supercomputer Center, where we were also shown some of the
		projects they have been working on. One of these projects was a simulator, using
		an Oculus Rift, of a home where one had to identify some of the hazards that
		medical staff might encounter when treating a patent at their home. Below is
		a video of myself while wearing this simulator. Sadly, I do not have a video
		of the environment I was in.

	</div>
	<p>
		In the last half of the day, we discussed the five projects offered. I hope to be
		a part of the Networking Design and Engineering project where we will create
		our own miniature version of OARNet. Afterwards, we were given an introduction
		to UNIX, which, while I knew a lot about, I did learn some new topics.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am very excited for tomorrow where we will have an introduction to MATLAB, then
		start on our training for our project.
