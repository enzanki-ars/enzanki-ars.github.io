						We finished our training for creating and connecting switches.  After saving the configuration we created for connecting two 
						switches together, we started connecting all of our switches together as shown below.

						After working on our new network, we visited the State of Ohio Computer Center where the supercomputers are housed.  We were 
						able to see all three of the current supercomputers; Glenn, Ruby, and Oakley.  Of the three supercomputers, Glenn is the oldest 
						and will be replaced soon.  Glenn also has the most differences between the supercomputer.  In order to cool the supercomputers, 
						Ruby and Oakley trap the heat in-between the two rows and cools from the outside, but Glenn traps cool air on the inside and pushes 
						the heat out.  Glenn also has a slightly different set of resources on the inside.  While Glenn contains only CPUs, Ruby and Oakley 
						also contain GPUs for even faster computing for certain types of jobs.  Below is a labeled picture of the inside of one Glenn node.

						Today, we got a tour of OARNet's data centers in Columbus.  I was shocked by the number of wires everywhere and that 
						the center is shared between many other companies.  The amount of data passed though OARNet and power used is staggering.  
						After a tour of OARNet, we continued learning how to connect multiple switches together as shown below.

						I have been holding off on posting about what we do at the dorms until now, but I thought now would be a great time to talk 
						about it here.  We have played so many games at the dorms, ranging anywhere from poker, played with goldfish and M&amp;Ms at 
						chips, to Apples to Apples.  We also end up spending a significant amount of time talking to the other groups about what we 
						did in our projects.
					</p>
					<p>
						Also, there are massive amounts of food surrounding me even as I am writing this.  As lunch is provided for us, our meal cards 
						have $20 left that we should use before the end of the night.  As we do not want to waste this money, we end up getting a lot 
						of snacks and beverages:

						Today, we toured the High Energy Density Research Lab where they fire a very powerful lazer at a small piece of metal to 
						observe the protons emited.  To demonstrate how powerful these lazers are, and to show how they test the acuracy of the lazers, 
						they placed a piece of burn paper in part of the lazer.  Below is a video of this demonstation.

						After our tour, we were introduced to the Juniper Networking Switches.  After booting up the loud machines, we learned how to
						use the command line access the switches.  We then discussed how networking works.

						I am now a part of the networking project group.  After an introduction to MATLAB, an interesting and unique type of
						programming language where the picture below was created by another student, we started on our project training.  During
						our training time, we discussed the binary numbering system.  We also discussed how to convert from binary to hexadecimal
						in order to determine why I addresses are written the way they are. Tomorrow, we will discuss how networks operate.

						Another exciting day at the Summer Institute.  To start the day, we had an introduction to the Ohio
						Supercomputer Center and the Supercomputers they utilize.  Supercomputers are defined as computers
						that are exponentially faster than computers used at home.  Initially, I thought that these supercomputers
						are one large computer with many processors, but they are actually many smaller nodes
						with fast interconnects.  These nodes can communicate with the other nodes via a fast, low latency
						connection like Ethernet.  We also discussed OARNet, originally created to connect researchers to the
						Supercomputer via phone lines.  Currently, the system is used to connect many of the universities, schools,
						and public broadcasting networks, for example, our local PBS affiliates, with high speed internet.
						This system offers speeds about 5000 times faster than your home internet and most of the traffic that passes
						through is, not surprisingly, Netflix.  I would be curious to know if the Hilliard City School District uses
						OARNet for their Internet.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also toured the Ohio Supercomputer Center, where we were also shown some of the projects
						they have been working on.  One of these projects was a simulator, using an Oculus Rift, of a home where
						one had to identify some of the hazards that medical staff might encounter when treating a patent at their
						home.  Below is a video of myself while wearing this simulator.  Sadly, I do not have a video of the environment
						I was in.

						In the last half of the day, we discussed the five projects offered.  I hope to be a part of the Networking
						Design and Engineering project where we will create our own miniature version of OARNet.  Afterwards, we were
						given an introduction to UNIX, which, while I knew a lot about, I did learn some new topics.
					</p>
					<p>
						I am very excited for tomorrow where we will have an introduction to MATLAB, then start on our training for
						our project.

						Welcome!  First post on my blog here, and first day at the <a href="https://www.osc.edu/education/si"> Ohio Supercomputer Center's Summer Institute</a>.  Today was just a check-in and get to know everyone,
						but I am really excited for the rest of the next two weeks.  We will be learning about all sorts
						of topics, ranging from Unix to MATLAB, and visiting many of the buildings around the Ohio State
						Campus, including a tour of the High Energy Density Physics Area.  Tomorrow, we will be introduced
						to the five projects we will choose from: <a href="https://www.osc.edu/content/nanofluidics">Lab-on-a-chip
						Nanofluidics</a>, <a href="https://www.osc.edu/education/si/projects/comet">Image Processing</a>, Cancer
						Cell Migration, Invasion and Metastasis, Networking Design and Engineering, and The Physics of Addicting
						Video Games.
