			<b>6-25-2015: Thursday</b>
			<p>Today we visited OSU's Center for Automotive Research. I did
				not realize that OSU designed and raced many different types of
				vehicles. We saw their Formula SAE car, the Bullet Car, the EcoCar,
				and more. I personallythink the EcoCar was the most interesting.
				They used a Cheverolet chasis and used a Honda engine that they
				modified to use E-85.</p>
			<p>We also focused on finishing our presentation. While our
				network is not fully operational, the focus of our project was not
				on the final network fully working, but was on learning how networks
				operate and the protocols behind them. I cannot wait to present our
				project.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="post">
			<b>6-24-2015: Wednesday</b>
			<p>Today we focused on finalizing our "project" and starting on
				our presentation. I do applogize that this post is short, but much
				of what we did in our presentation.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="post">
			<b>6-23-2015: Tuesday</b>
			<p>It was another day of breaking then fixing things. We
				continued learning about router protocols, connecting the eight
				routers in odd fashions to better understand how connections work.
				For example, we have been focusing on creating complex networks, not
				exactly efficient networks. We also have been discussing how we will
				present our project. I look forward to our presentation and can't
				wait to show what we have learned.</p>

			<p>Let me start off by first saying that -30&deg;F is very cold.
				But more about that in a moment...</p>
			<p>Today, we continued with our networking project. We have so
				many wires on the table, it isn't funny anymore. If someone brought
				in a pair of scissors and cut even one wire, we would be spending
				the next ten minutes figuring out which one was cut.</p>
			<p>
				After some minor technical difficulties in our configurations, we
				visited the Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center to learn about
				the types of projects they are working on. I did not know that this
				research facility is one of the largest users of the Ohio
				Supercomputer Center. The Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center has
				been developing a model for the weather patterns in the polar
				regions for pilots to use to know their landing conditions. An
				example of one of their live models is accessible <a
					href="http://polarmet.osu.edu/nwp/animation.php?model=antarctic_wrf&run=00&var=plot001">here</a>.
			</p>
			<p>After an introduction to the models, we saw their massive
				collection of rocks from the polar regions and entered the room
				where they store ice core samples. The picture below of the
				thermometer is the temperature in the room where they cut the
				samples, not the temperature of the storage room. The storage room
				was about -30&deg;F when we entered. And I thought waiting at the
				bus stop before school was cold during the winter...</p>

			<p>We finished our training for creating and connecting switches.
				After saving the configuration we created for connecting two
				switches together, we started wiring all of our switches together as
				shown below.</p>
			<img src="img/multiswitchconfigdia.png"
				alt="Picture of New Switch Configuration" width="100%"
				style="max-width:100%">
			<p>After working on our new network, we visited the State of Ohio
				Computer Center where the supercomputers are housed. We were able to
				see all three of the current supercomputers; Glenn, Ruby, and
				Oakley. Of the three supercomputers, Glenn is the oldest and will be
				replaced soon. Glenn is significantly different than the other two.
				In order to cool the supercomputers, Ruby and Oakley trap the heat
				in-between the two rows and cools from the outside, but Glenn traps
				cool air on the inside and pushes the heat out. Glenn also has a
				slightly different set of resources on the inside. While Glenn
				contains only CPUs (Central Processing Unit), Ruby and Oakley also
				contain GPUs (Graphic Processing Unit) for even faster computing for
				certain types of jobs. Below is a labeled picture of the inside of
				one Glenn node.</p>

			<p>Today, we toured one of OARNet's data centers in Columbus. I
				was shocked by the number of wires everywhere and that the center is
				shared between many other companies. The amount of data passed
				though OARNet and power used is staggering. After a tour of OARNet,
				we continued learning how to connect multiple switches together as
				shown below.</p>
			<img src="img/2switchconfigdia.png"

			<p>I have been holding off on posting about what we do at the
				dorms until now, but I thought now would be a great time to talk
				about it here. We have played so many games at the dorms, ranging
				anywhere from poker, played with goldfish and M&amp;Ms at chips, to
				Apples to Apples. We also end up spending a significant amount of
				time talking to the other groups about what we did in our projects.
			</p>
			<p>Also, there are massive amounts of food surrounding me even as
				I am writing this. As lunch is provided for us, our meal cards have
				$20 left that we should use before the end of the night. As we do
				not want to waste this money, we end up getting a lot of snacks and
				beverages:</p>

			<p>Today, we toured the High Energy Density Research Lab where

				I am now a part of the networking project group. After an
				introduction to MATLAB, an interesting and unique type of
				programming language (see example MATLAB creation by Vilas Winstein
				below), we started on our project training. During our training
				time, we discussed the binary numbering system. We also discussed
				how to convert from binary to hexadecimal in order to determine why
				IP addresses are written the way they are. Tomorrow, we will
				investigate how networks operate.</p>

				Another exciting day at the Summer Institute. To start the
				day, we had an introduction to the Ohio Supercomputer Center and the
				Supercomputers they utilize. Supercomputers are defined as computers
				that are exponentially faster than computers used at home.
				Initially, I thought that these supercomputers are one large
				computer with many processors, but they are actually many smaller
				nodes with fast interconnects. These nodes can communicate with the
				other nodes via a fast, low latency connection like Ethernet. We
				also discussed OARNet, originally created to connect researchers to
				the Supercomputer via phone lines. Currently, the system is used to
				connect many of the universities, schools, and public broadcasting
				networks, for example, our local PBS affiliates, with high speed
				internet. This system offers speeds about 5000 times faster than
				your home internet and most of the traffic that passes through is,
				not surprisingly, Netflix. I would be curious to know if the
				Hilliard City School District uses OARNet for their Internet.</p>
			<p>
				We also toured the Ohio Supercomputer Center, where we were
				also shown some of the projects they have been working on. One of
				these projects was a simulator, using an Oculus Rift, of a home
				where one had to identify some of the hazards that medical staff
				might encounter when treating a patent at their home. Below is a
				video of myself while wearing this simulator. Sadly, I do not have a
				video of the environment I was in.</p>

					frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe>
			</div>
			<p>
				In the last half of the day, we discussed the five projects
				offered. I hope to be a part of the Networking Design and
				Engineering project where we will create our own miniature version
				of OARNet. Afterwards, we were given an introduction to UNIX, which,
				while I knew a lot about, I did learn some new topics.</p>
			<p>
				I am very excited for tomorrow where we will have an
				introduction to MATLAB, then start on our training for our project.

				Welcome! First post on my blog here, and first day at the <a
					href="https://www.osc.edu/education/si"> Ohio Supercomputer
					Center's Summer Institute</a>. 
				Today was just a check-in and get to
				know everyone, but I am really excited for the rest of the next two
				weeks. We will be learning about all sorts of topics, ranging from
				Unix to MATLAB, and visiting many of the buildings around the Ohio
				State Campus, including a tour of the High Energy Density Physics
				Area. Tomorrow, we will be introduced to the <a
					href="https://osc.edu/education/si/projects">five projects</a> 
				we will choose from: <a href="https://www.osc.edu/content/nanofluidics">
					Lab-on-a-chip Nanofluidics</a>, <a
					href="https://www.osc.edu/education/si/projects/comet">Image
					Processing</a>, Cancer Cell Migration, Invasion and Metastasis,
				Networking Design and Engineering, and The Physics of Addicting
				Video Games.
