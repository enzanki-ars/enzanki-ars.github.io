          Another exciting day at the Summer Institute.  To start the day, we had an introduction to the Ohio 
          Supercomputer Center and the Supercomputers they utilize.  Supercomputers are defined as computers 
          that are exponentially faster than computers used at home.  Initially, I thought that these supercomputers 
          was one large computer with many processors, but they are actually many smaller notes connected together 
          with fast interconnects.  These nodes can communicate with the other nodes via a fast, low latency 
          connection like Ethernet.  We also discussed OARNet, originally created to connect researchers to the 
          Supercomputer via phone lines.  Currently, the system used to connect many of the universities, schools, 
          and public broadcasting networks, for example, our local PBS affiliates, together with high speed internet.  
          This system offers speeds about 5000 times faster than your home internet and most of the traffic that passes 
          through is, not surprisingly, Netflix.  I would be curious to know if the Hilliard City School District uses
          OARNet for their Internet.

          We were also given a tour of the Ohio Supercomputer Center, where we were also shown some of the projects 
          they have been working on.  One of these projects was a simulator, using an Oculus Rift, of a home where 
          one had to identify some of the hazards that medical staff might encounter when treating a patent at their 
          home.  Below is a video of myself while wearing this simulator.  Sadly, I do not have a video of the environment
          I was in.

          In the last half of the day, we discussed the five projects offered.  I hope to be a part of the Networking 
          Design and Engineering project where we will create our own miniature version of OARNet.  Afterwards, we were 
          given an introduction to UNIX, which, while I knew a lot about, I did learn some new topics.  
        </p>

          I am very excited for tomorrow where we will have an introduction to MATLAB, then start on our training for 
          our project.

          Welcome!  First post on my blog here, and first day at the <a href="https://www.osc.edu/education/si"> 
          Ohio Supercomputer Center's Summer Institute</a>.  Today was just a check-in and get to know everyone, 
          but I am really excited for the rest of the next two weeks.  We will be learning about all sorts 
          of topics, ranging from Unix to MATLAB, and visiting many of the buildings around the Ohio State 
          Campus, including a tour of the High Energy Density Physics Area.  Tomorrow, we will be introduced 
          to the five projects we will choose from: <a href="https://www.osc.edu/content/nanofluidics">Lab-on-a-chip 
          Nanofluidics</a>, <a href="https://www.osc.edu/education/si/projects/comet">Image Processing</a>, Cancer 
          Cell Migration, Invasion and Metastasis, Networking Design and Engineering, and The Physics of Addicting 
          Video Games.
