    <h2>Q&amp;A</h2>

    <h3>Expectations</h3>

    <h4>Why did you choose this experience?</h4>
    <p>
      The Ohio Supercomputer Center Summer Institute was a great opportunity to participate
      with others who are as excited to learn about the potential uses of supercomputers
      and how they can help solve practical problems. Computer science opportunities
      such as this are limited in the Hilliard City School District as computer science
      offerings have been cut over the past few years. As a result, I have sought
      out ways to expand my knowledge and the Summer Institute offered the potential
      experience I was looking for.
    </p>

    <h4>What new knowledge or new experiences did you hope to gain from this experience?</h4>
    <p>
      I expected to learn about how to create programs that efficiently utilize the supercomputerâ€™s
      resources, create efficient networks and how to program in a team environment.
    </p>

    <h4>How did you think you would benefit from your involvement?</h4>
    <p>
      As I would like to enter in the field of systems engineering and computer science,
      I felt the skills involved in the creation of projects utilizing these supercomputers
      would help deepen my understanding of the multiple processes involved.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>

    <h4>Explain how your experience affected you as a person? How did you change? How
      do you see the world differently than you did before? </h4>
    <p>
      Personally, I do not see the world any differently as a result of this experience.
      As I decided to use an educational experience for my capstone, the only change
      within myself was gaining new knowledge about computer science and networking.
    </p>

    <h4>Was this a meaningful experience?</h4>
    <p>
      The Summer Institute was a great experience for me because I had
      not only the opportunity to expand my knowledge about networking and supercomputers,
      but also campus life. I was able to get a feel for not just life in a dorm
      room, but transportation, dining, and the campus area. I was also able to meet
      new people with similar interests.
    </p>

    <h4>What new knowledge or skills did you learn from this experience?</h4>
    <p>
      Through my participation in this program, I learned about the basics of computer networking
      and the fundamentals of supercomputers. I gained hands-on experience in developing
      a network while working within a group and a better understanding of some of
      the challenges in creating and operating a network.
    </p>
    <p>
      For our final project, we created two set of networks and connected them as described
      in the <a href="/blog/index.html">blog</a>. While we were unable to complete
      the network, I felt like our project was a success as we were able to apply
      many of the basic networking protocols.
    </p>

    <h4>How would you do it differently if you had to start over?</h4>
    <p>
      The Ohio Supercomputer Center provided a wonderful opportunity that was well planned
      and perfectly executed. The only part I would have changed about this experience
      was the planning of this website. Originally, I created the entire website
      design from scratch, but it was very difficult to update every night in the
      dorm quickly. I experienced many road blocks that prevented timely updates,
      and there were also some issues with the display of some posts. I ended up
      redesigning the site with a template called Bootstrap that reduced design quirks
      once I returned to improve efficiency with the editing.
