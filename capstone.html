    <h2>Q&amp;A</h2>

    <h3>Expectations</h3>

    <h4>Why did you choose this experience?</h4>
    <p>
      The Ohio Supercomputer Center Summer Institute was a great opportunity to participate
      with others who are as excited to learn about the potential uses of supercomputers and
      how they can help solve practical problems.  Computer science opportunities such as this
      are limited in the Hilliard City School district as computer science offerings have been
      cut over the past few years.  As a result, I have sought out ways to expand my knowledge
      and the Summer Institute offered the potential experience I was looking for.
    </p>

    <h4>What new knowledge or new experiences did you hope to gain from this experience?</h4>
    <p>
      I expected to learn about how to create programs that efficiently utilize the supercomputerâ€™s resources, create efficient networks and how to program in a team environment.
    </p>

    <h4>How did you think you would benefit from your involvement?</h4>
    <p>
      As I would like to enter in the field of systems engineering and computer science, I felt the skills involved in the creation of projects utilizing these supercomputers helped deepen my understanding of the multiple processes involved.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>

    <h4>Explain how your experience affected you as a person?  How did you change?  How do you see the world differently than you did before? </h4>
    <p>
      Personally, I do not see the world any differently as a result of this experience.  As I decided to use an educational experience for my capstone, the only change within myself was gaining new knowledge about computer science and networking.
    </p>

    <h4>Was this a meaningful experience?</h4>
    <p>
      I felt that this was a very meaningful experience as I gained knowledge not offered within the Hilliard City School District.  As I stated above, I wanted to learn more about computer science, and as our district had limited opportunities, I began to search for other ways to expand my knowledge.  When I heard about the Summer Institute, I realized that it would be a perfect opportunity.
    </p>

    <h4>What new knowledge or skills did you learn from this experience?</h4>
    <p>
      As a part of this experience, I learned about the basics of computer networking and how supercomputers operate.
    </p>

    <h4>How would you do it differently if you had to start over?</h4>
    <p>
      I would not change anything of my experience other than the process of creating this website and blog.  The Ohio Supercomputer Center provided a wonderful opportunity that was well planned and perfectly executed.  The only part I would have changed about this experience was the planning of this website beforehand as I ended up redesigning the site once I returned to improve efficiency with the editing.
