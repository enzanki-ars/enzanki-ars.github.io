      I am studying at the Ohio State University, majoring in Computer
      Science and Engineering. In high school, I was a part of the Ohio
      Supercomputer Center's Summer Institute, which I used as my high
      school senior capstone.  In the past couple of years, I have created
      various videos and projects, many of them documented on this website.
      Currently, I work with the Engineering Technology Services at the
      Ohio State University, assisting with the documentation, setup,
      and operation of the old and new College of Engineering network.
