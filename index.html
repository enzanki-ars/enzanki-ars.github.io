      I am studying at the Ohio State University, majoring in Film Studies
      with a minor in Video Arts. In high school, I was a part of the Ohio
      Supercomputer Center's Summer Institute, which I used as my high
      school senior capstone.  In the past couple of years, I have created
      various videos and projects, many of them documented on this website.
